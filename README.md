# HiveUnityAssets
The HiveUnityAssets are a collection of recurring functions needed for the development of research projects, this includes for example the logging of studies or the collection of measurement data within a study. 

## Installation
See: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

## Logging of tracking data
The LogTrackingData.cs and TrackingDataLogger.cs classes can be used to make records of the movement of study participants. The LogTrackingData is a manager class that must be set in the scene. Via TrackingDataLogger the recording can then be triggered easily and statically.
